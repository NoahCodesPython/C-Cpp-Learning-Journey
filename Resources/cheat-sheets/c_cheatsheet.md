## Basic Program Structure
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Your code here
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Data Types and Variables
```c
// Basic Data Types
int age = 18;           // Integer: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
float height = 5.8f;    // Single precision: ~7 decimal digits
double pi = 3.14159;    // Double precision: ~15 decimal digits
char grade = 'A';       // Single character
char name[50];          // String (character array)

// Type Modifiers
unsigned int positive = 100;    // Only positive numbers
long int big_number = 1000000L;
short int small = 32;
```

## Input/Output Operations
```c
// Output
printf("Hello %s, you are %d years old\n", name, age);
printf("Format: %%d(int) %%f(float) %%c(char) %%s(string)\n");

// Input
scanf("%d", &age);              // Read integer
scanf("%s", name);              // Read string (no spaces)
scanf("%f", &height);           // Read float
fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin); // Read string with spaces
```

## Control Structures
```c
// If-else
if (age >= 18) {
    printf("Adult\n");
} else if (age >= 13) {
    printf("Teenager\n");
} else {
    printf("Child\n");
}

// Switch
switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
        printf("Excellent\n");
        break;
    case 'B':
        printf("Good\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Need improvement\n");
}
```

## Loops
```c
// For loop
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
}

// While loop
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);
    count++;
}

// Do-while loop
do {
    printf("This runs at least once\n");
} while (0);
```

## Arrays
```c
// Declaration and initialization
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
char vowels[] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};

// Accessing elements
numbers[0] = 10;        // First element
int last = numbers[4];  // Last element

// 2D Arrays
int matrix[3][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7,8,9}};
```

## Functions
```c
// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Void function
void greet(char name[]) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}
```

## Pointers
```c
int num = 42;
int *ptr = &num;        // Pointer to num

printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr);     // Dereference pointer
printf("Address: %p\n", ptr);    // Print address
```

## Common Library Functions
```c
#include <string.h>
strlen(str);            // String length
strcpy(dest, src);      // Copy string
strcmp(str1, str2);     // Compare strings
strcat(dest, src);      // Concatenate strings

#include <math.h>
sqrt(16);               // Square root
pow(2, 3);              // Power (2^3)
abs(-5);                // Absolute value

#include <stdlib.h>
malloc(size);           // Allocate memory
free(ptr);              // Free memory
rand();                 // Random number
```

## File Operations
```c
FILE *file = fopen("data.txt", "r");
if (file != NULL) {
    char buffer[100];
    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file);
    fclose(file);
}
```

# C++ Programming Complete Cheat Sheet
*Student: NoahCodesPython | College Prep: S.A. Engineering College*

## Basic Program Structure
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Input/Output with iostream
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Output
cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;

// Input
cin >> age;
getline(cin, name);  // Read entire line with spaces
```

## Classes and Objects
```cpp
class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    
public:
    // Constructor
    Student(string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
    
    // Getter methods
    string getName() const { return name; }
    int getAge() const { return age; }
    
    // Setter methods
    void setName(string n) { name = n; }
    void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
    
    // Display method
    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};

// Using the class
Student s1("Noah", 18);
s1.display();
```

## Inheritance
```cpp
class Vehicle {
protected:
    string brand;
    
public:
    Vehicle(string b) : brand(b) {}
    virtual void start() { cout << "Vehicle starting" << endl; }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    Car(string b) : Vehicle(b) {}
    void start() override { cout << "Car engine starting" << endl; }
};
```

## STL Containers
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <map>

// Vector (dynamic array)
vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
numbers.push_back(6);
numbers[0] = 10;

// String
string text = "Hello";
text += " World";
cout << text.length() << endl;

// Map (key-value pairs)
map<string, int> ages;
ages["Alice"] = 25;
ages["Bob"] = 30;
```

## Function Overloading
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}

string add(string a, string b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Templates
```cpp
template<typename T>
T maximum(T a, T b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

// Usage
int max_int = maximum(5, 10);
double max_double = maximum(3.14, 2.71);
```

## Exception Handling
```cpp
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;  // This would cause an error
} catch (const exception& e) {
    cout << "Error: " << e.what() << endl;
} catch (...) {
    cout << "Unknown error occurred" << endl;
}
```

## File Handling
```cpp
#include <fstream>

// Writing to file
ofstream outFile("data.txt");
if (outFile.is_open()) {
    outFile << "Hello, File!" << endl;
    outFile.close();
}

// Reading from file
ifstream inFile("data.txt");
if (inFile.is_open()) {
    string line;
    while (getline(inFile, line)) {
        cout << line << endl;
    }
    inFile.close();
}
```

## Smart Pointers (Modern C++)
```cpp
#include <memory>

// Unique pointer
unique_ptr<int> ptr1 = make_unique<int>(42);

// Shared pointer
shared_ptr<int> ptr2 = make_shared<int>(100);

// No need for manual delete - automatic cleanup
```
